Checking the flop ratio:

flop ratio is given by:

$$ \texttt{flop ratio} = {\texttt{num of flops} \over  \texttt{total number of cells}} $$

Log file:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8d7ab5f-12e1-4dff-ae5c-9a7968269338)


$$ \texttt{flop ratio} = {1613 \over 14876} = 0.1084 $$

$$ \texttt{percentage of flops} = 10.84 $$


# <h1 id="header-2">Day 2</h1>

## <h1 id="header-2-1">Summary</h1>
The goal of Day 2 is to perform floorplanning and placement.

## <h1 id="header-2-2">Theory</h1>

### <h1 id="header-2-2-1">Floor Planning:</h1>

Core vs Die:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf74b383-5f76-4617-9790-dbaf223c216c)

Core is the inner region and die is the total region. Pad are placed in the middle.

$$ \texttt{utilization ratio} = {\texttt{Total area of the netlist} \over \texttt{Total area of the core}} $$

$$ \texttt{aspect ratio} = {\texttt{core height} \over \texttt{core width}} $$

The utilization ratio is typically set between 0.5 and 0.6 to allow room for optimizations, decoupling capacitors (decaps), and routing. These parameters can be controlled using specific keywords.

Floorplanning is done before placement to position pre-placed cells or blocks. This process fixes their positions and creates blockages for the placer in that area. Blocks are formed by partitioning the logic and assigning pins, then handed off to block owners for implementation, with guidance on area and dimensions. Blocks usually consist of cells that are repeated multiple times across the design or contain complex logic.

Placing these blocks is an optimization problem that considers factors such as proximity to ports and the order in which the blocks operate. Flylines help determine block placement during this phase.

Decoupling capacitors (decaps) act as local charge sources for instances, charging when no switching occurs and providing charge when switching happens. This helps reduce dynamic voltage drops. Decaps are typically placed around the blocks.

A single pathway for power delivery results in IR drop, even with decaps, as decaps can only charge up to Vsource - IR. Using a grid structure is crucial because it provides multiple pathways for different instances.

The area between the core and die is blocked off using logical cell placement blockages to prevent the placer from positioning cells there. Pins are placed in this region and can be equidistant or spaced randomly, depending on the block's input needs. Clock pins are larger than signal pins since they handle large fanout and require lower resistance.

The Power Distribution Network (PDN) is generally implemented during floorplanning, but in this case, it will be done after Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS).

### <h1 id="header-2-2-2">Placement:</h1>

Placement is done post placement of blocks and IO pins. 

The idea is to take the library information of the cells to implement the netlist on the design and come up with an optimal placement which could possibly pass timing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24951443-c606-4e5b-b05e-e47e022d3ada)

As shown below, the instances are initially placed according to the netlist, with those closest to the pins positioned near the IO pads.

For hard paths, placement is done first, and wireload estimates are used to calculate capacitance. If the slew threshold is not met, buffers are added to regenerate the signals and improve signal integrity.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/656327cd-f74e-41fd-9038-da219b94c956)

Once this is complete, congestion-aware analysis is conducted with ideal clocks.

Placement typically occurs in two stages:
1. **Global placement**: A coarse placement where legalizations are not yet considered.
2. **Detailed placement**: Legalizations are applied, and instances are arranged within the standard cell rows.
### <h1 id="header-2-2-3">Cell Design and Characterization flows:</h1>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662a8ab2-6471-4804-a6c5-8bc00db5068d)

We need to first design a cell according to the inputs as shown above. Spice models contain fixed information from foundry like VTHO, tox, capacitances, etc. There could be a lot of user defined specification like cell height, drive strengths, VM (point where Vin == Vout), position of pins, supply voltage, pin layers required, drawn gate length.

In circuit design the circuit is implemented to get required functionality and W/L is found for PMOS and NMOS for creating layout.

Euler's path is used to come up with stick diagrams and are then implemented according to DRC rules.

The stage is design is complete. Now the characterization is performed to obtain .libs.

Charactization is of three types and performed in GUNA(spice simulator):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dab416c-f6ad-4444-92e0-d37c0eb9b5bc)

### <h1 id="header-2-2-4">Timing Characterization:</h1>

For timing characterizations following definitions are important to calculate slew and delays:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebfca498-3457-486d-9305-aa1347a9ab63)

Propagation delays can be negative if input slew is too high or the thresholds defined are weird.

## <h1 id="header-2-3">Floorplanning lab</h1>

### <h1 id="header-2-3-1">Running Floorplanning</h1>

***run_floorplan*** command is used to run floor planning. All the system default commands are present in the following folder:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69bae8fc-43ed-48f3-bf36-87ce57f42c7a)

README.md file contains information about all keywords for all different steps as shown below for floorplanning.

### <h1 id="header-2-3-2">Reviewing results</h1>

#### <h1 id="header-2-3-2-1">Manually checking the def</h1>

Output is a def file:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/097762b3-485c-4f0f-960a-7a1a4a16b1a5)

There are 409 pins with defined locations.

A total of 21,230 components are present (synthesis had 14,876, with the difference of 6,354 due to the addition of tap cells and decaps).

Placement has not been defined for all logic instances, but tap cells and decaps have been placed.

Nets have logical connectivity specified, but, as expected, no routing has been done yet.

#### <h1 id="header-2-3-2-2">Calculating Core and Die area and utilization ratio</h1>

$$ \texttt{ Die Area} = \texttt{length} * \texttt{height} = {(660685-0) \over 1000} * {(671405-0) \over 1000} = 443587.21 \texttt{sq microns} $$

Core area: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eab46e48-5abc-4416-b54c-b9a58a8ca656)

$$ \texttt{ Core Area} = \texttt{width} * \texttt{height} = (655.04 - 5.52) * (658.24-10.88) = 420473.26 \texttt{sq microns} $$

chip area reported during synthesis:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0d76b8-cb36-4df2-8eb1-cc969aa1fd28)

core utilization ratio reported:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd05068d-ab6e-4ef9-a4bd-85e85703d882)

$$ \texttt{Calculated core utilization ratio from observation} = {147712.92 \over 420473.26} = 0.3513 $$

#### <h1 id="header-2-3-2-3">Reviewing the def using Magic</h1>

Following command is run to open Magic to review def file:

## <h1 id="header-2-4">Placement lab</h1>

### <h1 id="header-2-4-1">Running placement</h1>

To run placement below command is run:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/461bb7df-b0bc-423b-9317-25fb0b0a54ac)

placement optimizes a parameter called ***HPWL (Half parameter wirelength)*** and waits for overflow to converge

Both detailed and global placement is performed. Congestion aware placement is done.

### <h1 id="header-2-4-2">Reviewing results</h1>

Placed def is viewed in magic:

## <h1 id="header-3-2">16 Mask layers based CMOS fabrication process</h1>

First we need to select a substrate, here we select p type

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa527d2-be4e-4c68-bd9b-67d6b690f93d)

To create active regions, the first step is to grow a silicon oxide layer that will serve as an insulator. Next, a layer of Si3N4 is deposited on top. After this, photoresist is applied, and UV light is projected onto the areas to be removed. The red regions are protected by a mask, while the rest of the exposed regions react and can be washed away.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b59a7f-4359-4831-9bbe-6d895dca5a50)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f98756-3a53-48c8-8273-ead08c04227a)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1405c7e8-f7a0-4b16-8e8e-f5d395f9a48d)

Si3N4 is also etched out in the regions required.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/847260b1-9685-4e07-a50c-1b90cd6db079)

Next step is to remove the photoresist.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea887a0d-cf51-47f0-badc-084acf164aef)

We put the above output in an oxidation furnace which will create isolation regions. This process is called LOCOS (LOCal Oxidation of Silicon)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32597180-4dff-40b2-8b1f-61750bd5e4ed)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aec1ffd4-4ab5-4b30-af15-b50c922915cf)

Next step is to remove or etch out the Si3N4.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5899aacd-c163-401b-996a-17b2c2aa724b)

Next, we need to create the n-well and p-well.

The n-well is used for PMOS fabrication, and the p-well is used for NMOS fabrication. Since both cannot be fabricated simultaneously, one area must be protected while the other is being processed.

The same steps are followed here: a layer of photoresist is deposited, and the pattern for the area to be protected is defined. Mask2 is then used to shield one area while fabricating the other.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7769effc-6a34-422e-84b4-c01214650cb2)

Next step is to expose this photoresist to the UV light. So, same this UV light will react only to the exposed photoresist area.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e64ca778-f9be-4716-a5b2-0f2489bbe2b7)

   When we wash this particular thing into a solution, that exposed area of photoresist will washed away.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58baac40-94a5-4ad8-9bd5-a2ac6296192f)


We do ion implantation with boron atoms in this region. The oxide layer will be damnaged but will be taken care later.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70f5da1e-fc9d-4c7d-973b-856449d79c15)

Same steps are performed for nwell creation with phosphorus.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bd5d112-bb73-46aa-b49a-0f09da3733ef)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a495508-a5f7-4b94-9527-7580d1dd5f7c)

Now heat up the chip to reach required depth for the n and p well

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4efcec4-d0a9-4fbb-a842-be2d5ce8871b)

Threshold voltage is a function of doping concentration and oxide thickness. Hence it is important to be able to vary this.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d45c934-713f-42d9-a8ec-bc20a1cbb156)

   Fixing of oxide that got damaged while Ion implantations.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02cb341-3707-4cff-a31a-55a3f6f386ec)

Now we need to form of gate step:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcc47194-673b-4f3c-9513-2b25f97a70ee)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62744e7a-3c3d-439f-8004-1e916f7f54e1)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ba1725-0c13-418a-b0e3-caa8db0a915a)

   We try to achieve P+,P-,N in N-well when trying to fabricate the PMOS.

   Similarly, for NMOS, N+,N-,P doping profile is desired.

   The next step is to add a thin layer of screen oxide to avoid the effect of channeling where ions with high velocity could go very deep into the substrate.

   Till here, we have the local interconnects (0 level of metal), 1st level of interconnects (Aluminium interconnects).

   Now the next step is to again take this metal levels to the higher level metal.
